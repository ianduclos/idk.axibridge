### Bench eye-check of the URGENT round — opened 2026-07-13, owner: ian
- done: all 11 URGENT items merged to main (`16fc350`), suite 382,
  12/12 automated live checks passed.
- next: Ian verifies at the bench the four behavior changes machines can't
  judge: (1) image output now centers on the bed — does it feel right with
  stacks/regenerate? (2) image_threshold band select on a real photo,
  (3) portrait "Width (mm)" now means on-paper visual width, (4) the
  viewAxis fader fix — one fader's drag direction deliberately flipped in
  portrait (correct per the rotation math; revert candidate if it feels
  wrong: see the feat(view) commit).
- blockers: none.
- context: ROADMAP.md URGENT section (struck through, with notes);
  `tests/test_view_coherence.py` locks resolve view-independence.
