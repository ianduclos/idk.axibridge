### Bench eye-check of the 07-16→19 wave — opened 2026-07-19, owner: ian
- done: generator v2 (misremembered scribble masses + tone dial, glyphgram
  coherent-field + continuity), bench latch with coalesced undo, draw tool
  + response brushes all merged (main, suite 430); screen-level eye-checks
  passed via rendered PNGs and Playwright acceptance.
- next: plot on paper — (1) misremembered v2 on a real photo (tone ≈ 0.35,
  compare mass_style scribble vs blob), (2) glyphgram continuity 0.6 vs 1.0
  at pen width, (3) a response-brush stroke (watch dash density: ~174 lifts
  per stroke; a sparser dash variant is the queued tune), (4) velocity tube
  now ships WITHOUT centerline by default — confirm that reads right.
- blockers: none.
- context: docs/plans/draw-mode-RESULTS.md,
  docs/plans/response-brushes-RESULTS.md, ROADMAP 0a–0c.

### Bench eye-check of the URGENT round — opened 2026-07-13, owner: ian
- done: all 11 URGENT items merged to main (`16fc350`), suite 382,
  12/12 automated live checks passed.
- next: Ian verifies at the bench the four behavior changes machines can't
  judge: (1) image output now centers on the bed — does it feel right with
  stacks/regenerate? (2) image_threshold band select on a real photo,
  (3) portrait "Width (mm)" now means on-paper visual width, (4) the
  viewAxis fader fix — one fader's drag direction deliberately flipped in
  portrait (correct per the rotation math; revert candidate if it feels
  wrong: see the feat(view) commit).
- blockers: none.
- context: ROADMAP.md URGENT section (struck through, with notes);
  `tests/test_view_coherence.py` locks resolve view-independence.
